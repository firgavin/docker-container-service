##usage    
set-docker-conf.sh script has many options for advanced users that are members of multiple fiware tenants and want to create many docker configuration directories.
     >set_docker_conf.sh -h
     This script updates docker config file with Keystone
     tenant/token variables Keystone server IP must be specified
     either as script input or added to environment as KEYSTONE_IP
     variable. The rest (OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD...etc.) the script
     may get from environment, so in most cases it's enough to
     source OpenStack openrc file

     In case environment missing those variables those must be supplied as script arguments
     If no arguments specified will try to use defaults below:
