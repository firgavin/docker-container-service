#FIWARE Docker Container Service user guide
##Introduction
The FIWARE Docker Container Service exposes the docker API so that FIWARE users can leverage their local docker clients to remotely manage their docker containers on the FIWARE Lab. This document describes how to use the service.

##Quick Start
1) *Apply to get a FIWARE account*

You can get a FIWARE Account [here](https://account.lab.fiware.org/).

2) *Apply to get a FIWARE Docker Container Service Account*

**TO DO.  We need a FIWARE page for doing this!** 


3) Specify FIWARE Docker Container Service URL as the *DOCKER_HOST* endpoint

In order to prepare your docker client to interact with the FIWARE Docker Container Service you need export the service's URL to the DOCKER_HOST environment variable or reference the URL in each commands -H <services URL>

    >export DOCKER_HOST=130.206.126.17:2376

or

    >docker -H 130.206.126.17:2376

4) Set up *Docker configuration file*

The config.json file describes additional headers to include in the docker REST commands sent to the docker container servicer.  The the headers are X-Auth-Token and X-Auth-TenantId. 

The *config.json* takes the following form:

    { "HttpHeaders":
      {
        "X-Auth-Token": <keystone token id>,      
        "X-Auth-TenantId": <keystone tenant id>    
      }
    }


The default location of the configuration file is *$HOME/.docker*.  But you can use the docker --config flag to indicate another directory. 

There are many ways to get your keystone token id and tenant id.  For instance you could use curl.  But we have provided and utility called [set-docker-config](./set-docker-config.md) that makes creating your config.json file easy.
  
Create default docker configuration file, .docker/config.json, for default:

    >set_docker_conf.sh -t <fiware-tenant-name> -u <fiware-user-name> -p <user-password>
Run docker commands:

    >docker <cmd> 

Keystone token's expire after appproximately one day so you will need to update the configuration file daily.

For advanced users of set-docker-conf.sh script see [set-docker-config](./set-docker-config.md).

## Authorization

Communication with the service is through REST.  Tenant authorization is accomplished by specifying a valid FIWARE keystone token and tenant id in http  headers "X-Auth-Token" and "X-Auth-TenantId".  The token owner must be authorized to use the service.  If the token has expired or the token is not authorized to access the specified tenant the request will be rejected.

## Managing containers

Docker requests to manage your containers are supported, but they are limited to containers that belong to the specified tenant. For instance ps will only list continainers associated with the specificed tenant.

There are some restictions on docker requests to run and create containers.  
In brief the restrictions are related to the fact that the service has to insolate tenants from each other and from the docker host. 

## Networking containers

The port bindings to the host external ports are restricted to those that the docker auto assigns in the ephermal port range which typically ranges from 32768 to 61000.  Thus the -P or --publish-all flags are supported but specifying a value in the host port with the -p or --publish flag are rejected.

## Managing container data

The local host should not be referenced in your docker commands.  Commands that reference the local host will be rejected.  Thus a command that referene the docker host directory in the -v or --volume command is rejected.

## Managing docker images
Currently the service does note not allow you build or manage images.  However you can pull images from [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub).

Note: we do plan to support managing images in private repositories in the future.


##Docker Commandline
Once you prepare your docker client as described in [Quick Start](./#Quick Start) you can use
the (Docker CLI)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/].  
All the commands to manage your containers are supported.
But they are limited to containers that belonging to the tenant specified in your config.json file.  So ps will only list containers belonging to the specified tenant.

There are some restictions on docker run and create that are listed below:  

##Docker API
## Docker Compose
Currently docker compose is not supported because it does not accept headers in the docker configuration file.
